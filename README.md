## Instructions

### [Download the latest version here](https://github.com/Dulana57/FrostyFix/releases)

1. Launch FrostyFix
2. Pick game (or choose custom)
3. Press Enable Mods or Disable Mods
4. IMPORTANT: Choose one of the **After Patch Options**
5. Launch game through Frosty

## Info
#### **You must disable this whenever you play any other Frostbite game or if you encounter issues with other games.**
It is recommended to launch the game with Frosty after forcing mods.
It works directly from Origin/EA Desktop but it's better to launch Battlefront from Frosty Mod Manager/Editor to guarantee everything is working fine and to refresh your mod list.
**You must run this program again every time you want to play another Frostbite game**, so you can either disable mods or select the other game.
